After the extraction, proper care is essential to promote healing and prevent complications such as infection or dry socket. Patients are usually advised to avoid strenuous activity, not to disturb the extraction site, and to follow specific oral hygiene instructions provided by their dentist. Tooth extraction can help alleviate pain, prevent the spread of infection, and prepare the mouth for further dental treatments if needed.",

Dental implants offer several benefits, including improved chewing ability, enhanced appearance, and preservation of jawbone structure. They are a durable and long-lasting option, often preferred over traditional dentures or bridges. Proper oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups are essential to ensure the longevity and success of dental implants.",
